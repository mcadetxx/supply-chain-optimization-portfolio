### BUSINESS SITUATION

RNDC currently manages a complex distribution network serving 30+ states with annual operational expenses exceeding $50M. Despite recent improvements, we face ongoing challenges:

- **Demand Volatility:** 23% variance in monthly order volumes creating inventory imbalances
- **Transportation Inefficiency:** Freight costs represent 18% of COGS, above industry benchmark of 14%
- **Late Deliveries:** Current OTIF rate of 87% vs. industry best practice of 95%+
- **Supplier Performance:** Inconsistent lead times causing stockouts and rush orders
- **Limited Visibility:** Executive team lacks real-time insights into supply chain health

### STRATEGIC INITIATIVE

I am authorizing a **6-week intensive project** to develop a comprehensive Supply Chain Network Optimization platform that will:

1. **Reduce transportation costs by 15-20%** through network optimization
2. **Improve forecast accuracy to <8% MAPE** using advanced analytics
3. **Increase OTIF to 95%+** through predictive delay detection
4. **Provide executive visibility** via real-time Power BI dashboards
5. **Quantify supplier performance** enabling data-driven vendor decisions
